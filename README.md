## Technologies Used 

- HTML: For structuring the quiz layout and question interface.

- JavaScript: For managing quiz logic, scoring, and dynamic DOM manipulation. 

## How to Use the Quiz 

1. Open the index.html file in any browser. 
2. Read each question and select an answer using the radio buttons. 
3. After answering all questions, click the Submit button.

- The questions are stored in a JavaScript array of objects. 
- On page load, the script dynamically renders each question and its options. 
- When the user clicks “Submit”, the script compares the selected answers with the correct ones. 
- A score is calculated and displayed, along with a feedback message like “You scored 4 out of 5”.
